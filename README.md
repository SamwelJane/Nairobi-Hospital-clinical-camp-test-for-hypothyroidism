Hypothyroidism_Prediction
Introduction
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism.The data was collected from Thyriod Patient

1.1 Defining the Question
Using the data provided , I'm tasked to build a model that determine whether or not the patient's symptoms indicte that the patient has Hypothroid

1.2 Metrics for Success
Optimalize and come up with reliable prediction Model

That give an accuracy above 95%
Classify the patients into two groups
1.3 Context
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:
